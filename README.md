## Project Idea1:
### 1.  Project Title:
Next President Prediction
### 2.  Project idea description:
This is a project that used to predict the successful rate---to be elected as the next United State president---for each candidate. The ultimate goal is to predict who is the next president. However, according to the schedule of president vote, we cannot wait until the end of president vote and check the result with the reality. We could built a model/predict simulator and try our best to make it practice in the reality.

We would gather and analyze tweet data from the topic of president vote, then we could use sentiment analysis and some statistic model to train the data, then predict the ratio of next president. And we will visualize our result. 

In my undergraduate data science course, I have done a similar project like this. That project is to analyze Trump's twitter. We used python package like sentiment analysis to analyze the sentiment influence of Trump's tweet. For this project, rather than just focus on the twitter's data, we also can grab more data from several famous news website. We will add more features and will optimize the model to make the model practical to the reality. 
### 3. Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for)
For the parties and the citizen. Parties can know their situation in the competition. They could adjust their strategy according to the data report. For example, in the report we can analyze the news and tweets to calculate currently which demand is the most welcome, and can receive residents' trust. What points that arise residents' dissatisfied in opponent party. etc...
### 4. Technology stack:
For gathering data: Python, twitter API, tweepy , web crawler technology, PHP
For analysis: statistic model, machine learning model, general numerical and analysis package from python
also some package to Visualize data

## Project Idea3:
### 1. Project Title:
shopping bot(snkrs/supreme)
### 2. Project idea description:
2017, in Nike The ten series, there is a shoe which names the ten Chicago. In the resale market, it has resale value that more than 3k USD, however its retail price when it released is only 190 USD.  

In this project, we attempt to create a bot that help people successfully buy the hype item which usually sold out in a few seconds after the item released. In the process, we will analyze the frame of website and analyze the process of buying an item. Then we will accelerate the process of buying. For example, automatically add to cart and automatically checkout. The bot should be able to fit every situation, as it is very common in general hype item release that the website is crash and the server gets down. Moreover, we also need to personify bot's movement. For supreme website, it will have a system that detects bot. If add to cart too fast or checkout too fast could be recognize as using bot. The bot also need to recognize the Google Recapcha Checkpoint sign in the webpage and solve the obstacle that prevent Google detecting us as a robot. 
### 3. Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for)
Benefit for shoe&clothes reseller. Moreover, a successful bot also have a great market. We also can make money at the process of resell bots. The current most popular bot own at least 3k usd value in the bot market.

## Project Idea-4:  
### 1、Project Title:  
Streetlamp Energy-Saving System  
### 2、Project idea description:  
This is a business project in which I participated developed by Chongqing Green Technology co., LTD in China from 2015-2018. In the project, the system collects environmental data, such as illumination, temperature humidity and PM2.5, uploads them to the server. After comprehensive calculation and overall processing, the brightness and color temperature of the street lights can be automatically adjusted (also can be monitored and maintained through the app), making road lighting more energy efficient and driving safety.In this project, we use expert system to calculate the brightness and color temperature that satisfies the road environment well.   

Originally I planned upgrade the system to the 2nd stage, applying SVM(Support Vector Machine), which is a classic method in machine learning, on the project instead of expert system. But on the half way I left the company and the research of machine learning stopped. If conditions allow, I want to continue my research on the Streetlamp Energy-Saving System with SVM or other machine learning platforms like TensorFlow to uptimize the project, making it more efficient on energy saving and traffic safety.

### 3、Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for)  
The project is to realize energy-saving on streetlamps. Usually the power of LED streetlight is 150W and 120W on the road and 60W in the tunnel. Urban road lighting consumes about 30% of China's total lighting power consumption. And If we can adjust the power of streetlamps according to traffic, we can save much energy. Also we can adjust the color temperature between white and yellow, which can help drivers to see the road more clearly in different weather.  

### 4、Technology stack:  
Server: JAVA with Springboot + Mybatis + Mysql as the core framework. Algorithm may be SVM developed by ourselves or public framework like TensorFlow. We need more time to confirm it.  
App: JAVA, Android Development Kit.  
Terminal(already developed on the street light): C, uCOSIII  
Additionally, if we want to do work on this project, I must get contact with the company first to ask for permit and devices.   
  
## Project Idea-5:   
### 1、Project Title:  
Smart Home Control System  
### 2、Project idea description:  
When I was an undergraduate, I created a startup and developed the system of smart home. But in the developing process, we found traditional smart home systems were not smart at all. Because traditional smart home companies, like Honeywell Siemens, were only good at embedded system, but didn’t know what AI was, which must be the key in smart home system. We also tried to figure it out, but we failed because we didn’t know machine learning.

But now, AI algorithms for business projects are more mature and I’m in Silicon Valley. So I want to try again with the help of Professor Ranjan, to make the smart home system really smart as if there was a virtual steward, who could controll lighting, curtains, TV, air conditioning, and monitoring for the master.

### 3、Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for)  
The main goal for smart home I think should be convenience, comfort and security for people. As an AI system, it should know what the master wants and prepare for him/her. For example, If the master comes to home, it should recognize the identity of the people and open the door and lights for the master if passed. When the master gets to the sofa, TV should be opened and favorite program should be selected. When the master wants to have a sleep in sofa, the system should turn down the light and TV.  

### 4、Technology stack:  
Server: JAVA with Springboot + Mybatis + Mysql as the core framework. Algorithm framework will be TensorFlow.   
App: JAVA, Android Development Kit.  
Terminal(already developed): C, Zigbee.  
  
## Project Idea-6:   
### 1、Project Title:  
Seeking Neighbors Strategy for Live Stream Transmission on P2P Network  
### 2、Project idea description:  
This project is difficult for us and it’s just a discussion. From 2018 to 2019, I was working on a live stream platform offering over than 200 English and Spanish TV channels, which was developed by a company in Shenzhen, China and its main market was South America.   

Because the number of online users increases dramatically, our old system couldn’t withstand a huge amount of stream data transmission, under which situation there would be a huge cost for servers and bandwith. I was assigned to join a group to develop a P2P stream transmission engine to replace the original engine, which push all the data for every TV terminal. Even traditional P2P technology is very mature, we still to make our P2P stream engine more efficient than others. First, we created a multi-way tree in the tracker server, which would calculate and assign nearest 30 nodes for each peer. Then the peer tried to make hole on the Internet and connect with neighbors by UDP.   

The first layer of the multi-way tree is the root node; the second layer is the operator node; the third layer is the public network address; the fourth layer is the NAT1 address; the fifth layer is the NAT2 address; the sixth layer is the UPNP address; the seventh The layer is the local address; the eighth layer is the node information (that is, the leaf nodes of the tree, the storage node quality information, resource information, etc.). Each layer performs insert sorting based on IP (converted to INT integer) when constructing and inserting nodes. At the same time, a hash map <node ID, node information> is established for all nodes. When a node PeerA requests its neighbors from the tracker, the node information is obtained through the node ID, and then the node information is used to traverse the leaf node position of the seven-layer multi-tree in reverse order, searching for its siblings, and checking whether there are matching resources. , If there is, then add it to the node list; if not, search for its cousin node by the parent node. Until the threshold number is searched (30).  

But the previous searching-nodes method only used the two dimensions of the public network IP logical distance and the degree of resource matching are used to search for neighboring nodes, and the node quality is not reliable. 
### I think it we can apply RS(Recommender System) on the original system and uptimize tracker service and enhance the transmission quality of P2P Network. Attributes used in RS are as bellow:  
* Public network IP logical distance.  
* Telecom operator type.  
* The time of day.  
* Weekly time of day.  
* Resource ID.  
* The maximum number of load nodes ever uploaded.  
* Network Type.  
* Transmission ability of shared resources.  

The RS can be used to establish the list of recommendation neighbors. The similarity between nodes is calculated at 1-5 items, and the larger the 6-8 items, the better.  
### 3、Goal of the project (who are you developing the project for)  
The goal of the RS method is to help the tracker assign better quality nodes to every peer, which can not only reduce the cost of servers and bandwith, but also provide more stable live stream data for customers.  
### 4、Technology stack:  
Server: JAVA with Springboot + Mybatis + Mysql as the core framework. Algorithm framework will be TensorFlow.   
App: JAVA, Android Development Kit.
